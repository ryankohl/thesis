The affordances of an environment to an actor are the actions which the environment provides the actor.  To clarify what is meant by providing an action, [Scarantino 2002] characterizes affordances as dispositional properties of an environment vis-a-vis an actor.  This characterization reads the statement
    "This cliff is fall-off-able by that badger."
as meaning that the cliff has a property such that, under the right circumstances, if that badger scampers over the cliff's edge, it will probably plummet. 

Scarantino's account clarifies the nature of affordances by tying it to a dispositional account, but falls into a few well-known ruts associated with the particular theory of dispositions he uses.  In particular, his use of subjunctive conditionals to describe affordances leaves the delineation of circumstances too vague.  Moreover, his use of conditionals has difficulties in explaining certain complex dispositional situations known as finks and masks.  Finally, his probabilistic interpretation of dispositional manifestation limits our insight into whether an affordance is present to only empirical evidence.  

To improve on Scarantino's account, recent work from [Lowe 2011] is used to remove the stimulus-manifestation distinction.  According to Lowe, the manifestation of a disposition may have logical necessities, but no further description along the lines of triggers or circumstances is appropriate.  The benefits of this theory absolve Scarantino's account of the difficulties introduced by his conditional interpretation.  A further improvement is provided by [Manley Wasserman 2007], by which the intensity of two affordances can be determined empirically and explained ontologically (e.g. the badger is more prone to fall off this cliff when the fence is removed).

I. Analysis of [Scarantino 2002]
1. Affordances are
  a. based on objective properties of an actor and an environment
  b. dependent on a specific kind of activity
  c. independent from the perceptual experiences of the actor
  d. relational properties
  
2. Properties
  a. are the sets of all their instances, including possibilia
  b. are abundant
  c. are expressed by predicates
  d. have their meanings clarified by clarifying the semantics of the predicates expressing them
3. Predicates 
  a. are true or false 
  b. are ascribed to things in a way that reflects the underlying inherence of properties
  c. dispositional if 'their ascription entails subjunctive conditionals'(pp12)
    c1. "X is fragile" |= "if X were (suitably) hit, then X would break" (pp12)
    c2. "is fragile" is a predicate, 'being fragile' or 'fragility' is a property
  d. categorical if not dispositional
4. Subjunctive conditionals
  a. are based on [Mumford 1998]
  b. are entailed by conceptual necessity (as opposed to logical necessity)
    b1. e.g. "X is triangular" |= "if the sides of X were (suitably) counted, the result would be 3"
    b2.  This is a logical entailment, primarily derivable from an analysis of "is triangular" and "is counted"
5. Dispositional predicates
  a. entail subjunctive conditionals via conceptual necessity
  b. are incomplete predicates (according to [Prior 1985]
    b1. A predicate is incomplete if its truth value depends on a set of background circumstances
    b2. e.g. "X is fragile" at temperatures only below 10C
6. Scarantino's Thesis
  a. Affordances are dispositions
    a1. i.e. incomplete predicates that entail subjunctive conditionals via conceptual necessity
  b. Affordances are time-indexed
    b1. an affordance inheres in an environment only at particular times
  c. Affordances have the form: (pp 13)
     Let T be a time, 
         C a set of background circumstances, 
         S be a set of stimulating/triggering circumstances,
         E be an environment,
         A be an actor,
         P be a probability,
         M a Manifestation involving E and A
     At T, if C and S, then prob(M) = P
  d. Background circumstances can be neither listed exhaustively nor left open-ended (pp14)
    d1. They are accounted by relying on Normal Ecological Circumstances
  e. Affordances can be partitioned into:
     - Goal-affordances: manifested by the fulfillment of an intention
     - Happening-affordances: not goal-affordances
    e1. Affordances are only manifested when both the environment and actor are involved in the manifestation.
    e2 Goal-affordances:
      e2a. Define the capacities of actor A at time T to be the activities that A can do at T.
      e2b. Those capacities that involve the environment (at T) are affordances.
    e3 Happening-affordances: [original elaboration; see bottom pp17]
      e3a. Define the incidents of environment E to be those events that can be done by some part of E that is not A
      e3b. Those incidents of E that involve A (at T) are affordances.
