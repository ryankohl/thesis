1. Previous theories of affordances (post-Gibson)
   * Animal-relative categorical properties of an environment (Reed 1996)
	 * Environments are objects, affordances are properties of environments
	 * Animals discover affordances (affordances exist prior to their perception)
   * Animal-relative dispositional properties of the environment (Turvey 1992)
	 * Tendencies to manifest in certain circumstances (pp 4)
	 * If the circumstances obtain, the affordance must manifest
	 * A disposition disappears if there are no circumstances for its manifestation (pp 4)
	 * The animal participates in both the triggering and the manifestation of the disposition (pp 5)
   * Affordances relate to an animal's effectivities (Turvey 1992, Michaels 2000)
	 * An effectivity is a disposition to act
   * Affordances relate to an animal's body scale (Stoffgren 2000 Heft 1989)
	 * The ratio of the size of an animal's body parts to a part of the environment grounds the affordance in the animal
	 * e.g. The length of a leg compared to the height of a stair determines the climbability of a staircase.
2. Affordances are relations between features of an environment and abilities of an animal
   * A feature is to situations as properties are to objects
	 * "feature placing" discussed in (Strawson 1959, Smith 1996)
	 * beyond reference to a situation/environment as a whole, no predication is needed
	 * e.g. "it's raining" "it's time to swing the bat"
   * Abilities are functional properties of animals (not dispositions) (Millikan 2000)
	 * they are not guaranteed to manifest when triggering circumstances obtain (pp 14)
	 * abilities can malfunction (e.g. you can trip while walking in ideal circumstances)
   * ex/ a room with a staircase affords Stan climbability, due to 
	 * the feature of climbability (via the staircase? or is that a predication?)
	 * the ability of Stan to climb those stairs (his legs are long enough, he's flexible enough, he's not dizzy, etc)
3. Affordances are perceived directly (pp 16)
  * Act of perception: (perceives animal (affords-F feature ability))
  * Perceptual experience: (perceives animal affords-F)
	 * the relata of the affordance are usually not perceived
4. A niche is a set of affordances for a particular animal (Gibson 1979)
  * "An animal's abilities imply an ecological niche." (pp 17)
  * "an ecological niche implies an animal." (pp 17)
  * An animal's niche is the set of situations in which one or more of its abilities can be exercised. (pp 18)
5. Events are changes in the layout of affordances (pp 19, Chemero 2000)
  * For an affordance to change, either the animal-relatum or environment-relatum changes
  * Usually, an animal's abilities remain constant
  * :. An event is a change in the environmental situation (ie features of the environment)
