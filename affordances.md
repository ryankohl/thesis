Affordances

I. Analysis of Chemero 2003

1. Previous theories of affordances (post-Gibson)
   * Animal-relative categorical properties of an environment (Reed 1996)
	 * Environments are objects, affordances are properties of environments
	 * Animals discover affordances (affordances exist prior to their perception)
   * Animal-relative dispositional properties of the environment (Turvey 1992)
	 * Tendencies to manifest in certain circumstances (pp 4)
	 * If the circumstances obtain, the affordance must manifest
	 * A disposition disappears if there are no circumstances for its manifestation (pp 4)
	 * The animal participates in both the triggering and the manifestation of the disposition (pp 5)
   * Affordances relate to an animal's effectivities (Turvey 1992, Michaels 2000)
	 * An effectivity is a disposition to act
   * Affordances relate to an animal's body scale (Stoffgren 2000 Heft 1989)
	 * The ratio of the size of an animal's body parts to a part of the environment grounds the affordance in the animal
	 * e.g. The length of a leg compared to the height of a stair determines the climbability of a staircase.
2. Affordances are relations between features of an environment and abilities of an animal
   * A feature is to situations as properties are to objects
	 * "feature placing" discussed in (Strawson 1959, Smith 1996)
	 * beyond reference to a situation/environment as a whole, no predication is needed
	 * e.g. "it's raining" "it's time to swing the bat"
   * Abilities are functional properties of animals (not dispositions) (Millikan 2000)
	 * they are not guaranteed to manifest when triggering circumstances obtain (pp 14)
	 * abilities can malfunction (e.g. you can trip while walking in ideal circumstances)
   * ex/ a room with a staircase affords Stan climbability, due to 
	 * the feature of climbability (via the staircase? or is that a predication?)
	 * the ability of Stan to climb those stairs (his legs are long enough, he's flexible enough, he's not dizzy, etc)
3. Affordances are perceived directly (pp 16)
  * Act of perception: (perceives animal (affords-F feature ability))
  * Perceptual experience: (perceives animal affords-F)
	 * the relata of the affordance are usually not perceived
4. A niche is a set of affordances for a particular animal (Gibson 1979)
  * "An animal's abilities imply an ecological niche." (pp 17)
  * "an ecological niche implies an animal." (pp 17)
  * An animal's niche is the set of situations in which one or more of its abilities can be exercised. (pp 18)
5. Events are changes in the layout of affordances (pp 19, Chemero 2000)
  * For an affordance to change, either the animal-relatum or environment-relatum changes
  * Usually, an animal's abilities remain constant
  * :. An event is a change in the environmental situation (ie features of the environment)

II. Analysis of Withagen Chemero 2011

1. Gibson argued for a direct perception of the environment (pp 4)
  * Due to physical laws and properties, things reflect ambient energy arrays
  * Regularities in these arrays are experienced as stimulus patterns in a perceiver
  * The features of a stimulus pattern depend on the
	* surrounding environment's properties
	* physical laws
	* relationship between the perceiver and the environment
  * Because stimulus patterns encode information about environmental properties, they specify environments
  * Animals experience stimulus patterns in terms of affordances
  * Direct perception is the detection of patterns that specify a state of affairs.
2. Gibson argued that affordances are not grounds for classification (pp 6)
  * Class membership is grounded on the identification of a property held in common by all members
  * Affordances are grounded (in part) on the relationships between the environment and perceiver
	* :. One environment can offer different affordances to different perceivers
  * An affordance can be related to a set of critical points
	* A critical point is a physical property an object must have in order to afford a certain behavior
	* The critical points of an affordance determine its boundary
	* e.g. A window tinted too thickly fails to afford the ability to see through it (by most people)
	* "Critical points are perceivable, determinate boundaries for action possibilities." (pp 7)
  * Affordances can be mis-perceived (pp 7)
	* An object without an affordance can reflect an energy array with a high family resemblance to those reflected by objects with the appropriate critical points
	* An object with an affordance can likewise appear very much like an object lacking the affordance

III. Analysis of Turvey 1992
---
1. Assumptions (pp 3)
  * ecological materialism: Nothing exists but matter (understood at all scales, not just atomic)
  * dynamism: "There are no changeless things and no thingless changes"
  * property essentialism: "There are only propertied things".  Neither properties nor things exist independently.
2. Definitions (pp 4)
  * substantial thing: a thing governed by physical laws (?)
  * substantial property: an objective feature possessed by some (substantial) thing
  * attribute/predicate: a subjective feature possessed by some thing 
	* can successfully or unsuccessfully represent a substantial property
  * intrinsic property: substantial properties of single things
  * relational property: substantial properties of n-tuples of things
  * law: an invariant relation between substantial properties
	* laws prescribe what can possibly occur
	* laws cannot prescribe what necessarily occurs without the incorporation of circumstances
	* "Real posibility is identical to lawfulness" (pp 5)
  * law statement: a conceptualization of a law
  * disposition: a substantial property that is latent
	* all dispositions come in pairs - a capability and an effectivity
	* whether a disposition is considered a capability or an effectivity vis a vis its complement depends on the focus of the particular analysis (ie who is considered to be active, and who is acted upon). (pp 7,8)
	* the product of the JOIN function exhibits the manifestation of a disposition
	
```	
Refractivity: light rays are refractable iff some things are refractive (pp 6,7)
	  let X be a light ray, p be X's refractability
	  let Z be a prism, q be Z's refractivity
	  then W= JOIN(X,Z,p,q), r be W's refraction
	  such that neither X nor Z possesses r
	  and W possesses neither p nor qj
	  
```

3. Theory of affordances (pp 8)
  * An affordance is a disposition of a surface layout, whose complement is a disposition of a particular animal
  * "A disposition is tantamount to an actual state of affairs minus particular conditions.  When the missing conditions are provided, actuality ensues." (pp 7)

IV. Analysis of Stoffregen 2003

1. Turvey is wrong to assert that affordances are dispositions of an environment with complementary dispositions possessed by particular animals.
  * Dispositions are the wrong kind of property (pp 5)
	* An animal in an environment is capable of many actions at any particular time.  Turvey artificially forces the selection of just one action with the JOIN function, which filters all the available dispositions into just one affordance and one effectivity.
  * Affordances are not properties of just the environment (pp 7)
	* Direct perception is pretty important for affordance theories in ecological psychology.  If an animal can directly perceive an affordance as a dispositional property of an environment, it seems unlikely that the animal can simultaneously perceive its own (or another animal's) effectivity directly. 
2. Affordances are emergent properties of the animal-environment system (pp 9)

``` 
	let X be a staircase with property p, the height of its stairs
	let Z be a person with property q, its leg length
	let W = JOIN(X,Z,p,q)
	let the relation between p and q entail that W has property h
	:. h is an affordance of W iff neither X nor Z possesses h
```

  * The major difference with Turvey's theory is that the affordance is a non-dispositional property of the system (state of affairs) that supervenes on the relationship between relevant properties of the system's constituents.
  * Intentions are the complement of affordances (pp 11)
	* Behavior is the result of the conjunction of an affordance and a complementary intention
	  * e.g. stair-climbing results from 
		* affordance: the opportunity to climb stairs
		* intention: the desire to go to the upstairs library

V. Analysis of Smith Varzi 2002 (Surrounding Space)
---
1. A niche is defined by a medium, a kind of tenant, and a retainer
  * A medium is a substance spatially contained within a niche that is relevant to the behavior and survival of the niche's kind of tenant and encompasses its tenants.
	* Mediums surround and are connected to their tenants.  Medium-tenant and medium-retainer contact is made possible due to the intervening space that partially constitutes the medium.  (pp 9)
	* For example, the air inside a cave is a medium for bears that may dwell in that cave.  Although water is critical for a bear's survival, it is not part of the cave-niche's medium unless the bear swims in the water.
	* A niche's medium carries all the defining properties of a niche vis-a-vis its tenants. (pp 10)
  * A niche's kind of tenant determines the behavioral and survival processes that need to be supported by the a niche.  A cave may be a niche for a bear but not for a deer.
	* In order for something to be a medium, tenants of the appropriate kind must be nearby the purported niche in some sense.  (pp 8)
	* The difference between an empty bear home and a cave is that there is a reasonable chance that a bear will occupy that cave in the near future.
  * A retainer ensures that a niche's medium remains present.
	* A house ceases to be a home when its windows are shattered in the winter.  Without an intact retainer, the air temperature drops below a threshold required to support human survival.  Thereby the niche loses its medium due to a faulty retainer.
	* Retainers are what Gibson calls affordances (pp 11) - they cause the medium of a niche to retain its defining properties vis-a-vis its tenants.
	* "A retainer must be the boundary of a solid physical structure." (pp 11)
2. Niches can be changed when the tenants of two or more niches interact.  The niches may combine, overlap, or change in size. (pp 21)
3. What's wrong
  * The definition of a niche's medium depends too much on the metaphor of air or water 
  * Retainers are too spatially-dependent in their definition to be affordances
  * The double-hole thing doesn't do much explanatory work in clarifying what affordances are - too many corner cases seem to rise
	* Such as the odd boundary betw animals and the air around them...there's no apparent bona fide point that distinguishes the air in my respiratory system and the air in front of me
4. What's right
 * Animal behavior seems to be precisely the connection between animals and their environment, particuarly in the relationship of affordance
 * The idea that retainers are things that sort of protect the defining behaviors of an animal's environment from encroaching processes is interesting.  Take away the spatial aspect, and retainers might make sense in their negative role for affordance stability.
 * Mediums taken as the things that support the animal's behavior in the environment can be generalized beyond air-water life support things to encompass exactly the affordances that define an animal's environment.
 * The rest of the spatial stuff relating to the delineation of place is good and suitable for describing environments, although the topology stuff (like fiat convex hulls) might be out-of-place
