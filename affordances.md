Affordances
===

The affordances of an environment to an actor are the actions which the environment provides the actor.  To clarify what is meant by providing an action, [Scarantino 2002] characterizes affordances as dispositional properties of an environment vis-a-vis an actor.  This characterization reads the statement

**"This cliff is fall-off-able by that badger."**

as meaning that the cliff has a property such that, under the right circumstances, if that badger scampers over the cliff's edge, it will probably plummet. 

Scarantino's account clarifies the nature of affordances by tying it to a dispositional account, but falls into a few well-known ruts associated with the particular theory of dispositions he uses.  In particular, his use of subjunctive conditionals to describe affordances leaves the delineation of circumstances too vague.  Moreover, his use of conditionals has difficulties in explaining certain complex dispositional situations known as finks and masks.  Finally, his probabilistic interpretation of dispositional manifestation limits our insight into whether an affordance is present to only empirical evidence.  

To improve on Scarantino's account, recent work from [Lowe 2011] is used to remove the stimulus-manifestation distinction.  According to Lowe, the manifestation of a disposition may have logical necessities, but no further description along the lines of triggers or circumstances is appropriate.  The benefits of this theory absolve Scarantino's account of the difficulties introduced by his conditional interpretation.  A further improvement is provided by [Manley Wasserman 2007], by which the intensity of two affordances can be determined empirically and explained ontologically (e.g. the badger is more prone to fall off this cliff when the fence is removed).

1. Affordances are
  - based on objective properties of an actor and an environment
  - dependent on a specific kind of activity
  - independent from the perceptual experiences of the actor
  - relational properties
2. Properties
  - are the sets of all their instances, including possibilia
  - are abundant
  - are expressed by predicates
  - have their meanings clarified by clarifying the semantics of the predicates expressing them
3. Predicates 
  - are true or false 
  - are ascribed to things in a way that reflects the underlying inherence of properties
  - dispositional if 'their ascription entails subjunctive conditionals'(pp12)
     * "X is fragile" |= "if X were (suitably) hit, then X would break" (pp12)
     * "is fragile" is a predicate, 'being fragile' or 'fragility' is a property
  - categorical if not dispositional 
4. Subjunctive conditionals
  - are based on [Mumford 1998]
  - are entailed by conceptual necessity (as opposed to logical necessity)
    b1. e.g. "X is triangular" |= "if the sides of X were (suitably) counted, the result would be 3"
    b2.  This is a logical entailment, primarily derivable from an analysis of "is triangular" and "is counted"	
5. Dispositional predicates
  - entail subjunctive conditionals via conceptual necessity
  - are incomplete predicates (according to [Prior 1985]
     * A predicate is incomplete if its truth value depends on a set of background circumstances
     * e.g. "X is fragile" at temperatures only below 10C	 
6. Scarantino's Thesis
  - Affordances are dispositions
     * i.e. incomplete predicates that entail subjunctive conditionals via conceptual necessity
  - Affordances are time-indexed
     * an affordance inheres in an environment only at particular times
  - Affordances have the form: (pp 13)
	Let T be a time, 
		C a set of background circumstances, 
		S be a set of stimulating/triggering circumstances,
		E be an environment,
		A be an actor,
		P be a probability,
		M a Manifestation involving E and A
	At T, if C and S, then prob(M) = P
  - Background circumstances can be neither listed exhaustively nor left open-ended (pp14)
	 * They are accounted by relying on Normal Ecological Circumstances
  - Affordances can be partitioned into:
     * Goal-affordances: manifested by the fulfillment of an intention
     * Happening-affordances: not goal-affordances
     * Affordances are only manifested when both the environment and actor are involved in the manifestation.
     * Goal-affordances:
		 - Define the capacities of actor A at time T to be the activities that A can do at T.
		 - Those capacities that involve the environment (at T) are affordances.
     * Happening-affordances: [original elaboration; see bottom pp17]
		 - Define the incidents of environment E to be those events that can be done by some part of E that is not A
		 - Those incidents of E that involve A (at T) are affordances.

1. Well-known problems with the Conditional Analysis
  - Finks - when the conditions for a disposition are fulfilled, the disposition is removed, preventing the manifestation
  - Masks - when the conditions are fulfilled, the circumstances are changed, preventing the  manifestation
  - One fix is to leave behind the CA altogether
2. Dispositions do not have stimuli/triggers (pp 5)
  - Replace the material/subjunctive conditional with a causal predicate
>   ex/ 
>     "X is soluble iff if X is placed is water then X is dissolving."
>     Remove the predicates "is placed in water", "is dissolving"
>     Replace with "is dissolved by water"
>     Reformulate: "X is soluble" iff "X can be dissolved by water"
  - A manifestation is a causal state of affairs (pp 6)
     * A conditional does not causally link a stimulus with a manifestation (pp 8)
	 * The circumstances of a disposition's manifestation may be varied, and thus difficult to capture as a simple conditional.  The complexity of the conditional structure would need to match the complexity of the underlying causal state of affairs.  Because the dissolution of salt in water is complicated, the failure of "is placed in water" to be a satisfactory stimulus is unsurprising. (pp 9)
	 *  In the above conditional analysis of water solubility, an additional problem is the fact that "is placed in water" is a logically necessary condition of being dissolved in water, since water cannot dissolve something at a distance.
	 *  A causal relationship can't be drawn between two events (a stimulus and a manifestation) if the former is a logically necessary condition of the latter. (pp 12)
	 * If A is a logically necessary condition of B, then every time you have B, you have A (ie "B only if A").  But this is the reverse of the standard conditional analysis, where you expect "if A then B".  Clearly, you don't want causes and effects to be tied together in a biconditional.

1. Standard problems for the Conditional Analysis
  - Finks: X doesn't have the disposition to M under circumstances C, but if C obtains, then X acquires the disposition to M and X M's.
  - Reverse-Finks: X has the disposition to M under C, but if C obtains, then X loses the disposition to M and X fails to  M.
  - Masks: X has the disposition to M under C. When C obtains, X fails to M despite maintaining its disposition, due to additional circumstances.
  - Mimicking: M doesn't have the disposition to M under C.  When C obtains, X M's despite not having the disposition to do so, due to additional circumstances.
2. Solve by getting specific?
  - Lewis advises the specification of highly-specific stimulus conditions.
  - Unfortunately, every disposition can be masked or mimicked. (pp 8).
     * The argument turns around the identification of an Achilles' Heel - a circumstance that makes or breaks the highly-specified condition.  
	 * If the condition's specification is too rarified, then its manifestation can be described as an exception to a more acceptable general rule that the object is in fact not disposed to manifest.
	 * If the condition's specification covers too many cases, then the conditions become too gerrymandered to support a generalization of the predicate. (p10-12)
3.  Additional problems (pp 13)
  - Comparitive dispositional ascriptions (pp 13)
	 * The conditional analysis does not support the expression of one glass being more fragile than another, as the boolean conditional does not allow for a scale across its antecedents.
	 * Particular scales for particular dispositions can be defined (like Moh's scale of hardness/fragility), but not a general family of scales across all dispositions.
  - Context dependence (pp 14)
     * Without a general system for comparing dispositional ascriptions, there is no mechanism for shifting the semantics of a dispositional predicate from one context-dependent scale to another.
  - Absent stimulus conditions (pp 14)
     * Under the conditional analysis, how do you represent a person disposed to talk?  It's not the case that the talkative person is constantly talking, nor is it adequate to merely say that every time he could be quiet, he talks.
4. Solution: Comparing the number of stimulus situations (pp 18)
  - X is disposed to M under C iff N would M in a suitable proportion of C-situations
  - X is more disposed than Y to M when C iff X would M in more C-situations than Y
  - Benefits:
     * Avoids problems with finks, reverse finks, masks, and mimicks
     * Provides a mechanism for context dependence
     * Contexts differ not on the scale, but on the selected positions on the scale to mark boundaries. (e.g. microchip makers have a lower scale marker for fragility than masons).
     * Absent stimulus conditions
     * The absence of a restriction on C-situations just opens up the disposition to any kind of stimulus event.  In the case of being talkative, any two situations are equally valid excuses to start talking.
  - Bad things: (pp 20)
     * Degree of Manifestation: how do you reflect that a shattering reflects more seriously on an object's fragility than a cracking?
	 * Probability of Manifestation: how do you reflect that something is more fragile if it would evoke a 4" crack with a 90% probability after a fall than if it evoked a similar crack with only a 30% probability?
	 * Extrinsic dispositions: how do you reflect that two (intrinsically) identical castles differ in their vulnerability if one is placed on the top of a hill in friendly territory and the other in a narrow valley deep in enemy territory?
	 * Contextual importance: how do you reflect that some cases are more important to one group of people than another when assessing a disposition?
	 * How do you compare two sets of continuum-many stimulus events?  What about multi-dimensional cases (e.g. fragility assessed on two real-valued dimensions, temperature and height of drop).
5. Potential sources of aid:
  - vagueness in dispositional ascriptions (pp 23)
  - when intuitions of proportion fail (as with the multi-dimensional case), there may be reason to reassess the original dispositional ascription
