I. Analysis of [Scarantino 2002]
---

1. Affordances are
  - based on objective properties of an actor and an environment
  - dependent on a specific kind of activity
  - independent from the perceptual experiences of the actor
  - relational properties
2. Properties
  - are the sets of all their instances, including possibilia
  - are abundant
  - are expressed by predicates
  - have their meanings clarified by clarifying the semantics of the predicates expressing them
3. Predicates 
  - are true or false 
  - are ascribed to things in a way that reflects the underlying inherence of properties
  - dispositional if 'their ascription entails subjunctive conditionals'(pp12)
     * "X is fragile" |= "if X were (suitably) hit, then X would break" (pp12)
     * "is fragile" is a predicate, 'being fragile' or 'fragility' is a property
  - categorical if not dispositional 
4. Subjunctive conditionals
  - are based on [Mumford 1998]
  - are entailed by conceptual necessity (as opposed to logical necessity)
	* e.g. "X is triangular" |= "if the sides of X were (suitably) counted, the result would be 3"
	* This is a logical entailment, primarily derivable from an analysis of "is triangular" and "is counted"	
5. Dispositional predicates
  - entail subjunctive conditionals via conceptual necessity
  - are incomplete predicates (according to [Prior 1985]
	* A predicate is incomplete if its truth value depends on a set of background circumstances
	* e.g. "X is fragile" at temperatures only below 10C	 
6. Scarantino's Thesis
  - Affordances are dispositions
	* i.e. incomplete predicates that entail subjunctive conditionals via conceptual necessity
  - Affordances are time-indexed
	* an affordance inheres in an environment only at particular times
  - Affordances have the form: (pp 13)
  
```
	Let T be a time, 
		C a set of background circumstances, 
		S be a set of stimulating/triggering circumstances,
		E be an environment,
		A be an actor,
		P be a probability,
		M a Manifestation involving E and A
	At T, if C and S, then prob(M) = P
```	
  - Background circumstances can be neither listed exhaustively nor left open-ended (pp14)
	 * They are accounted by relying on Normal Ecological Circumstances
  - Affordances can be partitioned into:
     * Goal-affordances: manifested by the fulfillment of an intention
     * Happening-affordances: not goal-affordances
     * Affordances are only manifested when both the environment and actor are involved in the manifestation.
     * Goal-affordances:
		 - Define the capacities of actor A at time T to be the activities that A can do at T.
		 - Those capacities that involve the environment (at T) are affordances.
     * Happening-affordances: [original elaboration; see bottom pp17]
		 - Define the incidents of environment E to be those events that can be done by some part of E that is not A
		 - Those incidents of E that involve A (at T) are affordances. 

II. Analysis of [Lowe 2011]
---

1. Well-known problems with the Conditional Analysis
  - Finks - when the conditions for a disposition are fulfilled, the disposition is removed, preventing the manifestation
  - Masks - when the conditions are fulfilled, the circumstances are changed, preventing the  manifestation
  - One fix is to leave behind the CA altogether
2. Dispositions do not have stimuli/triggers (pp 5)
  - Replace the material/subjunctive conditional with a causal predicate
  - e.g.
	 * "X is soluble iff if X is placed is water then X is dissolving."
	 * Remove the predicates "is placed in water", "is dissolving"
	 * Replace with "is dissolved by water"
	 * Reformulate: "X is soluble" iff "X can be dissolved by water"
  - A manifestation is a causal state of affairs (pp 6)
     * A conditional does not causally link a stimulus with a manifestation (pp 8)
	 * The circumstances of a disposition's manifestation may be varied, and thus difficult to capture as a simple conditional.  The complexity of the conditional structure would need to match the complexity of the underlying causal state of affairs.  Because the dissolution of salt in water is complicated, the failure of "is placed in water" to be a satisfactory stimulus is unsurprising. (pp 9)
	 *  In the above conditional analysis of water solubility, an additional problem is the fact that "is placed in water" is a logically necessary condition of being dissolved in water, since water cannot dissolve something at a distance.
	 *  A causal relationship can't be drawn between two events (a stimulus and a manifestation) if the former is a logically necessary condition of the latter. (pp 12)
	 * If A is a logically necessary condition of B, then every time you have B, you have A (ie "B only if A").  But this is the reverse of the standard conditional analysis, where you expect "if A then B".  Clearly, you don't want causes and effects to be tied together in a biconditional.
  
  
III. Analysis of [Manley Wasserman 2007]
---

1. Standard problems for the Conditional Analysis
  - Finks: X doesn't have the disposition to M under circumstances C, but if C obtains, then X acquires the disposition to M and X M's.
  - Reverse-Finks: X has the disposition to M under C, but if C obtains, then X loses the disposition to M and X fails to  M.
  - Masks: X has the disposition to M under C. When C obtains, X fails to M despite maintaining its disposition, due to additional circumstances.
  - Mimicking: M doesn't have the disposition to M under C.  When C obtains, X M's despite not having the disposition to do so, due to additional circumstances.
2. Solve by getting specific?
  - Lewis advises the specification of highly-specific stimulus conditions.
  - Unfortunately, every disposition can be masked or mimicked. (pp 8).
     * The argument turns around the identification of an Achilles' Heel - a circumstance that makes or breaks the highly-specified condition.  
	 * If the condition's specification is too rarified, then its manifestation can be described as an exception to a more acceptable general rule that the object is in fact not disposed to manifest.
	 * If the condition's specification covers too many cases, then the conditions become too gerrymandered to support a generalization of the predicate. (p10-12)
3.  Additional problems (pp 13)
  - Comparitive dispositional ascriptions (pp 13)
	 * The conditional analysis does not support the expression of one glass being more fragile than another, as the boolean conditional does not allow for a scale across its antecedents.
	 * Particular scales for particular dispositions can be defined (like Moh's scale of hardness/fragility), but not a general family of scales across all dispositions.
  - Context dependence (pp 14)
     * Without a general system for comparing dispositional ascriptions, there is no mechanism for shifting the semantics of a dispositional predicate from one context-dependent scale to another.
  - Absent stimulus conditions (pp 14)
     * Under the conditional analysis, how do you represent a person disposed to talk?  It's not the case that the talkative person is constantly talking, nor is it adequate to merely say that every time he could be quiet, he talks.
4. Solution: Comparing the number of stimulus situations (pp 18)
  - X is disposed to M under C iff N would M in a suitable proportion of C-situations
  - X is more disposed than Y to M when C iff X would M in more C-situations than Y
  - Benefits:
     * Avoids problems with finks, reverse finks, masks, and mimicks
     * Provides a mechanism for context dependence
     * Contexts differ not on the scale, but on the selected positions on the scale to mark boundaries. (e.g. microchip makers have a lower scale marker for fragility than masons).
     * Absent stimulus conditions
     * The absence of a restriction on C-situations just opens up the disposition to any kind of stimulus event.  In the case of being talkative, any two situations are equally valid excuses to start talking.
  - Bad things: (pp 20)
     * Degree of Manifestation: how do you reflect that a shattering reflects more seriously on an object's fragility than a cracking?
	 * Probability of Manifestation: how do you reflect that something is more fragile if it would evoke a 4" crack with a 90% probability after a fall than if it evoked a similar crack with only a 30% probability?
	 * Extrinsic dispositions: how do you reflect that two (intrinsically) identical castles differ in their vulnerability if one is placed on the top of a hill in friendly territory and the other in a narrow valley deep in enemy territory?
	 * Contextual importance: how do you reflect that some cases are more important to one group of people than another when assessing a disposition?
	 * How do you compare two sets of continuum-many stimulus events?  What about multi-dimensional cases (e.g. fragility assessed on two real-valued dimensions, temperature and height of drop).
5. Potential sources of aid:
  - vagueness in dispositional ascriptions (pp 23)
  - when intuitions of proportion fail (as with the multi-dimensional case), there may be reason to reassess the original dispositional ascription

IV. Analysis of [Mumford Anjum 2011]
---
1. "X is a cause of Y" (pp 2)
  - means that X is something that disposes towards Y
  - means that X does not necessitate Y
	  * thus, something could have prevented Y from occuring
  - means more than Y is possible
  - X is a cause of Y to a certain degree, which can be greater, lesser, or equal to that of another cause of Y
	  * the gradation of causal force is often conveyed by (conditional) probabilities
  - Conventional representations of causal situations (e.g. neuron diagrams and structural equations) fail to adequately account for the above complications
2. Powers can be represented by vectors defined on a quality space
  - Causation involves properties, and frequently a change in property (pp 3)
	  * ex/ an increase in temperature, a decrease in volume
  - Let S be a property space, and F,G be points at opposite extremes of S
	  * Vector Magnitude: represents the degree of causal force (e.g. probability)
	  * Vector Direction: represents the kind of manifestation, F or G the disposition aims at
	  * Vector Addition: represents the total causal effect of a (polygenic) situation
   - A vector represents an active disposition
	  * a vector can be inactive, but this is different from a passivist notion of being unstimulated (pp 5).  
3. An active causal situation may yield no manifestation (pp 5)
   - If the sum of the participant vectors in a situation 'cancel each other out', then there is no overall disposition towards either extreme of a property space.
   - Referred to as a 'causation of absence'
4. Special values in the property space can be singled out as thresholds
   - Sometimes these thresholds indicate a physical event, such as the boiling point of water
   - Other times these indicate a goal, like a comfortable setting for a thermostat
5. Vectors can be defined in multi-dimensional property spaces
   - Sometimes an apparantly multi-dimensional situation can be broken down into a conjunction of single-dimensional cases (pp 9)
   - Other times, a disposition could essentially vary across two or more property spaces, in which case multi-dimensional vectors are called for.
	   * N-dimensional (N>2) cases are represented by 3-dimensional polyhedra of 2^N sides
6. Probabilistic causation is represented as a disposition towards event occurrences (pp 9)
   - Consider the disposition of a flipped coin to land:
	   * Define an event space with two outcomes, Heads and Tails
	   * Define a two-headed vector, two heads with equal magnitude and opposite direction.
	   * Interpret the vector magnitudes as probabilities, summing to unity
   - Consider the disposition of a loaded die rolling on a table:
	   * Define an event space with six outcomes
	   * define a six-headed vector, each head pointing at some outcome
	   * the sum of the vector's magnitudes sum to unity, but are not all equal
	   * question: assume a wizard intervenes as the dice is rolled, dramatically increasing the chance that a 'six' results.  Does he have a choice in whether he only modifies the head of the vector pointing towards 'six', and the other five heads adjust accordingly (in order to sum to unity)?  Or, does the wizard necessarily have to account for each other head?  If other vectors were involved, would the wizard necessarily have to account for these as well?
7. Causation by absence (pp 10)
   - Dispositions can be active without (apparent) stimuli.  
   - Interventions into a causal situation can nullify a disposition (represented by vector addition).
   - If an intervention does not take place, then the unimpeded disposition can go ahead and cause a manifestation to occur.
   - e.g. If I forget to water a flower for a month, did I cause it to wilt?  I may be guilty, but the cause was the plant's dispositions (particularly, its dispositions to consume water and to wilt when dry).  However, it is water's power to impede these dispositions and my ability and responsibility to bring water the plant that both explains my guilt and makes the following counterfactual true: "if I had watered the plant, it might not have died."
8. Not all vectors can be happily added (pp 12)
   - Consider a property space with two extremes: being happy and being sad
	   * eating a chocolate bar disposes somebody to be happy
	   * eating ten chocolate bars disposes somebody to be sad
   - Only some property spaces are linear, accomodating vector addition
   - Other property spaces require a different notion of dispositional composition

V. Analysis of Manley Wasserman 2007
---
1. The conditional analysis of dispositions cannot accomodate comparative dispositional ascriptions
   - e.g. This glass is more fragile than that cup.
2. Standard approach to gradable predicates
   - Refer to a scale along which predicated objects are compared
   - Define positive (i.e. non-comparative) predicates using the scale and context
   - e.g. 
	   * define a 'scale of height'
	   * define the comparative 'is taller than' for people on this scale
	   * define the positive 'is tall' on the scale, using context to set it to 
		   * heights greater than 6'
		   * heights in the 90th percentile
   - Standard conditional analysis doesn't incorporate a scale
3. Defining a dispositional scale
   - Use the conditional probability that a disposition would manifest given that is was triggered
	   * e.g. P(x breaks | x is dropped) < P(y breaks | y is dropped)
	          :. x is less fragile than y
	   * Problems:
		   * Assuming that dispositions are intrinsic, conditional probabilities fail to distinguish intrinsic and extrinsic conditions
			   * e.g. Glass X dropped from 100' is more likely to break than Glass Y dropped from 2".  However, this does not mean that X is therefore more fragile than Y.
			   * To block this, the context needs to be tightly specified
		   * Assuming a deterministic environment, an object's dispositional degree is not the same as its probability of manifesting.  
			   * Dispositional degree: in how many scenarios does the disposition manifest?
			   * Probability of manifestation: in how many tests does the disposition manifest in this scenario?
4. The dispositions of two objects can be compared by counting stimulus-cases (pp 4)
   - A stimulus case is a fully specific scenario that settles everything causally relelvant to the manifestation of the disposition.
	   * i.e. a precise combination of values for variables on which the disposition is causally dependent.
   - X is more disposed than Y to M given C
     iff
	 there are more C-cases in which X M's than in which Y M's
   - Issues:
	   * The meaning of 'there are more As than Bs' is unclear when predicating over scenarios, given the set of scenarios is non-denumerable.  
		   * There is some sense in saying that there is a measure on all real-valued heights between 1' and 8', and more values lie between 2' and 8' than 1' and 2'.
	   * An ordering of stimulus-cases may be required for cases where a notion of 'close scenarios' is important.  
	       * e.g. X is more prone to be attacked than Y iff there are more enemies of X close by than enemies of Y, even though Y has more enemies overall across the globe.
	   * There is no accounting for the degree of manifestation on this account
	       * e.g. X is more fragile than Y if X and Y break in all the same scenarios, but X is pulverized into a fine powder, while Y fractures into two or three large pieces.
	   * The account does not cover the case of an indeterministic world, where instead of "X M's" you have "X M's with probability P".
		   * e.g. Assume X and Y 'probably break' in all the same scenarios, but X has a greater probability of breaking in each scenario.  Then we'd want to say that X is more fragile than Y.
5. Positive dispositions are defined in terms of comparative dispositions (pp 6)
   - e.g. We understand 'is fragile' better after we've gone to the trouble of specifying what it means for X to be more fragile than Y.
   - Avoids masking and finking by tying the definition of a disposition to a context.
	   * The s-cases for a disposition can include masking and finking cases
   - In cases (or theories) without stimulus conditions, defining comparative dispositions is still useful.
	   * Stimulus cases are essentially a filter, removing all the irrelevant scenarios vis-a-vis the disposition in question.  By removing the filter, all scenarios become relevant.

VI. Synthesis
---
1. Scarantino advocates the representation of affordances with dispositional predicates.  
   * The truth value functions of these DPs depends on a set of background circumstances.  Background circumstances are described in terms of normalcy for a particular (kind of) environment.
   * DPs entail subjunctive conditionals via conceptual necessity (as opposed to logical necessity).  
   * Affordances are manifested by either 
	   * an actor fulfilling an intention with the help of the environment
	   * part of the environment causing an event that the actor participates in
2. The use of subjunctive conditionals to define DPs runs into some serious problems
3. Manley and Wasserman define DPs in terms of how many situations a manifestation would result.
	   * Typically, a certain kind (or collection of kinds) of situation is called out as a stimulus case.  Out of all these stimulus cases, if the proportion of cases that lead to a manifestation exceed some threshold, then a disposition is present.
   * Many DPs can be better understood by explaining their underlying Comparative DPs.
	   * Fragility is better understood by explaining what it means for X to be less fragile than Y.
   * Comparative DPs are defined using a scale for their stimulus cases
	   * "is more fragile than" is defined on a scale for measuring the severity of impacts.  If X breaks over a narrower range of this scale than Y, then X is less fragile than Y.
4. Lowe defines DPs in terms of causal predicates
   * Instead of using a conjunction of conditional statements to convey the meaning of a DP, use causal predicates that convey the potential events that the object can participate in.
	   * e.g. X is soluble iff X can be dissolved by water
	   * The complexity here lies not in the dispositional predicate, but in the nature of dissolvings.
5. Mumford and Anjum represent DPs as vectors towards events (construed as changes in a quality space)
   * vector magnitude: probability of manifestation
   * vector direction: kind of manifestation
   * vector addition: polygenic effects in a linear quality space
6. Affordances are dispositional predicates that relate to environments and actors as described by Scarantino.
   * Dispositional predicates entail causal predications via conceptual necessity
	   * causal predications are made true by causal processes
   * dispositional predicates can be represented as vectors 
	   * towards a kind of event 
	   * with a magnitude defined on a scale for measuring the causal liklihood for that event kind
		   * the causal liklihood of an event is based on the proportion of processes that culminate in an event of the relevant kind 
		   * with affordances, the causal liklihood will have spatial and temporal neighborhood constraints that keep the processes relatively local
